# Tic-Tac-Toe Bot
This was my first coding project. It is a C program that plays tic-tac-toe against you, and is guaranteed to always either win or draw (it uses a winning strategy).

# Getting the Compiled Code
Either download the compiled code for MacOS from `bot` or download the source code from `bot.c` and compile however you normally compile C source code, for example using the GCC compiler.

# Playing Against the Bot
Run the compiled code. You should get text prompts for all of your moves, followed by a text rendition of the board. Note that moves are case sensitive and need to be formatted correctly.
